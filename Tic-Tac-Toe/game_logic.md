# Game Logic
Here is going to be added the Game Logic to have a better coding direction

# Rules
(Taked from vicmaster notes)
- Two players represented with X and O
- First time the game is played, X starts
- Each player alternate turns to put a mark in the board on any available slot
- The game ends when either one of the players matches three marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row or there are no more moves available
- Once the game finishes, players are asked if they want to play again. If they do, the player who lost the previous match starts. 
- In case of a draw, the player who did the second-to-last movement starts
